Living and working in the countryside

In the countryside, people usually live in a small town (e.g. 6,000 people) or village /vɪlɪdʒ/

(e.g. 700 people).

Nature means ‘everything in the natural world’. (= animals, birds, plants, etc.) There is wonderful wildlife in the north of the country. [animals, birds, fish and insects]

Near the village there is a conservation area [place where wildlife and nature are protected].

Common mistakes

I love nature [NOT I love the nature]. I like walking in the countryside [NOT I like walking in the nature].

How to learn vocabulary

To learn a lot of vocabulary, you have to do different things.

1 Study each unit of the book carefully and do all the exercises. Check your answers with your teacher. Repeat the units after a month, and then again after three months, and see how much you have learnt and how much you have forgotten. Repeating work is very important.

2 Keep a vocabulary notebook. Students who regularly make notes in a separate notebook often do better in tests and examinations than students who do not keep a notebook.

3 Use different ways of recording things in your notebook. For example, every time you see or hear an interesting phrase, write it in your notebook, and write who said it or wrote it, and in what situation, as well as what it means. Here are some examples:

ready: (person at the door of a theatre, to all the people waiting) ‘Have your tickets ready, please!’ = have your ticket in your hand

else: (person in a restaurant) ‘Would you like anything else?’= more or in addition or different rush hour: (person who is about to leave home for work) ‘I’m going early so that I miss the rush hour’ = the times when there are lots of people travelling to work in the morning or when people are travelling home in the evening

Making notes of the situations words are used in will help you to remember them and to use them at the right moment.

4 Use diagrams and other visual aids to help you learn and remember words and phrases. Word bubbles are very easy to draw and can help you remember the different meanings and uses of words. Here is an example for the word play, which can be a verb or a noun:

play football, tennis, golf, etc.

play the guitar, violin, piano, etc.

verb

PLAY

noun

theatre: a play by William Shakespeare

Charts can also help you to organise information about words. This student has made notes in her vocabulary notebook about useful verbs and the nouns we use them with: a taxi

a cold

dinner

my homework

take a message

a mistake

somebody a favour

violin lessons

catch a criminal

make

an

do

my best (to)

a ball

appointment
